I can't believe you're watching that.
	The Golf Channel? I'm into golf.
Since when?
	Since college. I used to play every day!

I'm into sports.
I'm into music.
I'm into rock and roll.
I'm into jazz.
I'm into classical music.
I'm into English.
I'm into reading.
I'm into sing.
I'm into cooking.
I'm into sleeping.
I'm into breathing.
I'm into stalking.
